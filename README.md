# Text Classification Project(Using self-implemented Naive Bayes)📗

## Overview 👀
Welcome to the Text Classification Project! In this project, I'll be implementing a text classification model using the NaiveBayes algorithm on the 20 Newsgroups dataset from scikit-learn.

## The Dataset 📦
### 20 Newsgroups Dataset
The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents spanning 20 different newsgroups. It is often used for text classification and clustering tasks. The dataset covers a wide range of topics, including politics, sports, technology, and more.

### Key Information:
- Classes/Topics: 20
- Data Split: Training and Testing
- Dataset Source: scikit-learn

### Dataset Exploration:
The dataset is distributed across various newsgroups, each representing a specific category.
It includes both the training and testing sets for comprehensive model evaluation.
Each document is labeled with its corresponding newsgroup, allowing for supervised learning.

## Acknowledgments 🙏🏻
This project is inspired by the scikit-learn community and the 20 Newsgroups dataset contributors.

Happy coding and text classifying! 🚀
